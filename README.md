# API v1

This describes the API version 1 for Zonalizer.  The URLs in this description
assumes that Lim operates without any prefixes and all structure examples are
in JSON.

## Data Model Overview

The data model is structured with a top level object called `analyze` which
contains information about the DNS tests that has been performed for a fully
qualified domain name (FQDN).

An analyze is kept in memory while its queued or analyzing then it's store into
a database for future access and long term storage.

All analysis are kept in spaces for seperation, see Spaces for more information.

## Data Types

The following data types are used:

* `uuid`: A version 4 UUID.
* `string`: An UTF8 string.
* `integer`: A signed big integer.
* `float`: A float.
* `href`: An URL pointing to another object or objects as according to HATEOAS.
* `datetime`: An UTC Unix Timestamp integer.

## HATEOAS

By default all URLs are HATEOAS but it can be disable via configuration or by
setting `base_url` to false (0) in the request for any call that returns objects
with URLs.

Example:

```
GET /zonalizer/1/analysis?base_url=0
```

## Pagination

All calls returning a list of objects will have the capabilities to return
paginated result using cursors.

The following URI query string options can be used:

* `limit`: This is the number of individual objects that are returned in each
  page, default and max limit is configurable.
* `before`: This is the cursor that points to the start of the page of data that
  has been returned.
* `after`: This is the cursor that points to the end of the page of data that
  has been returned.
* `sort`: The field name in the corresponding objects being returned that the
  result should be sorted on.
* `direction`: The direction of the result in conjunction with `sort`, can be
  `ascending` or `descending`.  Default is ascending.

Example:

```
GET /zonalizer/1/analysis?limit=100&after=cursor
GET /zonalizer/1/analysis?limit=10&sort=created&direction=descending
```

For each paginated result the following object is also included:

```
{
  ...
  "paging": {
    "cursors": {
      "after": "string",
      "before": "string"
    },
    "previous": "href",
    "next": "href"
  }
}
```

* `before`: This is the cursor that points to the start of the page of data that
  has been returned.
* `after`: This is the cursor that points to the end of the page of data that
  has been returned.
* `next`: The full API query that will return the next page of data.  If not
  included, this is the last page of data.
* `previous`: The full API query that will return the previous page of data.
  If not included, this is the first page of data.

## Configuration

Following configuration parameters exists and can be configured via Lim's YAML
config files.

### zonalizer

The following paramters can be configured below the root entry `zonalizer`.

#### base_url

A bool that controls if the base URL is included in the HATEOAS output.

#### custom_base_url

A string with a custom base URL that will be used if `base_url` is true, this
is helpful if Zonalizer is run behind load balancer or session divider.

#### db_driver

A string with the database driver to use.

#### db_conf

A hash this the database driver configuration, see Database Configuration.

#### default_limit

An integer with the default number of objects to return for calls that return
a list of objects.

#### max_limit

An integer with the maximum number of objects to return for calls that return
a list of objects, the given `limit` may not be larger then this and if it is
then the limit will be `max_limit`.

#### allow_ipv4

An integer which determines whether (1) or not (0) IPv4 is allowed to be used
for analyzing.

#### allow_ipv6

An integer which determines whether (1) or not (0) IPv6 is allowed to be used
for analyzing.

#### test_ipv4

An integer which determines whether (1) or not (0) to use IPv4 for analyzing if
not specified by the request.  Will be forced off (0) if IPv4 analyzing is not
allowed (`allow_ipv4`).

#### test_ipv6

An integer which determines whether (1) or not (0) to use IPv6 for analyzing if
not specified by the request.  Will be forced off (0) if IPv6 analyzing is not
allowed (`allow_ipv6`).

#### max_ongoing

The maximum number of ongoing analysis that can exist at the same time.  If this
is higher then the number of threads in the collector then the collector will
queue work.

#### allow_undelegated

An integer which determines whether (1) or not (0) undelegated analysis are
allowed to be run.

#### force_undelegated

An integer which determines whether (1) or not (0) undelegated information must
be giving in other to run any analysis.

#### max_undelegated_ns

An integer with the maximum number of `ns` objects that can be given in an
analysis request.

#### max_undelegated_ds

An integer with the maximum number of `ds` objects that can be given in an
analysis request.

#### collector

The following parameters are available to configure the collector.

##### exec

The path to the Zonalizer collector (zonalizer-collector).

##### config

Name of configuration file to load.

##### policy

Name of policy file to load.

##### sourceaddr

Local IP address that the test engine should try to send its requests from.

##### threads

Number of threads to start.

### Configuration example with defaults

```
---
zonalizer:
  base_url: 1
  db_driver: Memory
  default_limit: 10
  max_limit: 10
  allow_ipv4: 1
  allow_ipv6: 1
  test_ipv4: 1
  test_ipv6: 1
  max_ongoing: 5
  allow_undelegated: 1
  force_undelegated: 0
  max_undelegated_ns: 10
  max_undelegated_ds: 20
  collector:
    exec: zonalizer-collector
    threads: 5
```

## Spaces

A space is used as a seperation of analysis and is given as an optional option
to most calls, see Calls.

If given, calls will only create or return analysis for that corresponding
space.

If not given, calls will use the default configurable space or the "null" space.

The `id` of an analyze is unique within the corresponding space.

The "null" space is a reference to an unset space which, depending on the
database backend, can be `null`, `undef`, empty string or otherwise an unset
variable.

As an example; To separate a web app from a batch script, the web app may set
the space to "web" while the batch script sets it to "batch".  In this way they
will not pollute each other spaces.

## Undelegated Analyzing

Undelegated analyzing are done by manually giving the nameserver (see `ns`
object) and delegation signer (optional, see `ds` object) information that will
override DNS information looked up during analyzing.

Example senario taken from the Zonemaster project:

> An undelegated domain test is a test performed on a domain that may, or may
> not, be fully published in the DNS. This can be quite useful if one is going
> to move one's domain from one registrar to another. For example, if you want
> to move your zone example.com from the nameserver "ns.example.com" to the
> nameserver "ns.example.org". In this scenario one could perform an undelegated
> domain test providing the zone (example.com) and the nameserver you are moving
> to (ns.example.org) BEFORE you move your domain. When the results of the test
> are colour coded in green one can be fairly certain that the domain's new
> location is supposed to be replying to queries . However there might still be
> other problems in the zone data itself that this test is unaware of.

  to start processing it.
* `analyzing`: indicates that the analyze has been taken up by a worker and its
  processing it.

## Result Levels

The following result levels can be given by Zonemaster, please see Zonemaster
documentation for more details.

- DEBUG3
- DEBUG2
- DEBUG
- INFO
- NOTICE

- ERROR
- CRITICAL

## Errors

Errors that are related to the communication with the API are returned as JSON
in a `Lim::Error` format and other errors which are related to the processing
of analysis are set in the `error` object.

For example this is a internal server error (500):

```
{
  "Lim::Error" : {
    "module" : "Lim::Plugin::Zonalizer::Server",
    "code" : 500,
    "message" : null
  }
}
```
